# my-node-website
This is a website made in node. Not currently running on a server.

I used express.js to handle my requests. ejs to handle the views. paypal-rest-sdk to handle paypal payment option. Discord.js to send messages from website to discord bot.

This website is being used to show some of my work. This was originally placed on an ubuntu server running on aws. Private information is not filled in the files. 

There is a page for sending a message from the website to a private discord bot. This bot would send a message to a direct message from a user in the dicord server.
A page that includes some of my beats with a buying option. This sends a reciept with comformation of purchase to the seller.
